### To run hw8 code
Make sure you have navigated to the /hw8/ folder as the current directory and a test.db file is in there.
* If an error message pops up, try the suggested fix if one is mentioned.
* All programs perform some basic input error checking and will recommend a fix if the input error is detected.
* Type "cat prob\<#\>.sql | sqlite3 test.db" to run the particular problem's query.

### Test notes
* All code has been tested on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B running Raspbian.
* sqlite3 3.8.7.1 was used to run the code.
